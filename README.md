## 🧩 Part 2 – Scavenger Hunt

In Part 2 of this lab, I used browser Developer Tools (DevTools) to uncover hidden passcodes embedded in the HTML and CSS of the Lab 2 Scavenger Hunt website.
By inspecting elements, source files, and styles, I successfully found and recorded all required passcodes.
These codes have been included in the repository as part of the submission.
