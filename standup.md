## Yesterday’s Work:
- **Christoph Koelsch**: 
  - Finalized the folder structure for the project, setting up `index.html`, `style.css`, and `main.js`. The foundation is now ready for future development.
  - Started implementing the UI for the device pairing wizard, focusing on the initial layout and basic flow.  
  - Connected Bluetooth/WiFi scanning logic to the pairing process.

- **Paul Fritz**: 
  - Designed the wireframe for the homepage layout. Translated the design into HTML/CSS, making sure the layout is responsive across devices.
  - Began testing the basic structure of the homepage to ensure compatibility on both Android and iOS.
  - Assisted with the UI design of the device pairing wizard, ensuring that the steps are intuitive.

- **Vanessa Reich**:
  - Integrated Bluetooth scanning logic and began testing for device discovery. 
  - Handled the error states during the pairing process, ensuring that users receive clear feedback if the connection fails.
  - Worked on the success state for successful device pairing.

- **Viola Wollenweber**:
  - Created a mock for the device pairing wizard screens, defining user interactions and expected states.
  - Assisted in the creation of the project folder structure, confirming all necessary files are in place for smooth development.
  - Started implementing some unit tests for the device pairing logic.

- **Finja Sterner**:
  - Focused on writing unit tests for the pairing logic, testing the Bluetooth/WiFi connection handling and error reporting.
  - Helped troubleshoot Bluetooth scanning issues on iOS to ensure functionality on both platforms.

- **Lisa Fritsche**:
  - Wrote documentation for the device pairing process, detailing each step for developers and end-users.
  - Provided feedback on the UI design of the device pairing wizard to ensure accessibility and usability for all users.

## Today’s Plan:
- **Christoph Koelsch**: 
  - Continue working on implementing the success and error states for the device pairing process.
  - Review Bluetooth/WiFi scanning logic for edge cases and improve the feedback loop.

- **Paul Fritz**:
  - Finalize the homepage layout, adding missing elements and ensuring that it is fully responsive.
  - Begin working on additional UI components for the device pairing wizard (e.g., buttons, loading indicators).

- **Vanessa Reich**:
  - Test the pairing logic on both Android and iOS to ensure smooth functionality across platforms.
  - Continue working on handling the error and success states, ensuring that they are clearly communicated to the user.

- **Viola Wollenweber**:
  - Continue working on unit tests for the pairing logic, covering additional edge cases.
  - Assist in the integration of the Bluetooth/WiFi scanning logic with the UI for real-time feedback.

- **Finja Sterner**:
  - Write more unit tests for the pairing logic, especially for success/error handling.
  - Begin preparing a test suite for the homepage layout to check for cross-platform compatibility.

- **Lisa Fritsche**:
  - Begin drafting the user instructions for the device pairing process and how to troubleshoot common issues.
  - Help with further testing and refinement of the UI design for the device pairing wizard.

## Blockers:
- **Christoph Koelsch**: Waiting for confirmation from the backend team about the device types supported for pairing.
- **Paul Fritz**: Need access to the latest design files for the homepage layout.
- **Vanessa Reich**: Encountered issues with device discovery on iOS. Need assistance with debugging Bluetooth on iOS.
- **Viola Wollenweber**: Waiting for the latest UI mockups to finish integration testing.
- **Finja Sterner**: Facing issues with Bluetooth/WiFi connection timeout on Android. Investigating potential fixes.
- **Lisa Fritsche**: Need final approval from the product team on the user instructions before publishing.

## Notes:
- **Christoph Koelsch**: Make sure the feedback during the pairing process is clear and informative for users.
- **Paul Fritz**: Ensure that the design for both platforms (Android and iOS) is as close to identical as possible for a consistent experience.
- **Vanessa Reich**: Test pairing with at least three different types of devices to ensure compatibility.
